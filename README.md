## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alexis Rueda

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software developer with a focus on Angular and Spring Boot, creating dynamic web applications that bridge the gap between frontend and backend efficiently.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Software Development Engineering at UVEG and enhancing my skills in advanced microservices architecture and WebSocket communication to build even more scalable applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve modern web technologies or foundations that create social impact through technology.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about connecting Angular with Spring Boot using WebSocket, or anything related to modern JavaScript frameworks and backend development!
